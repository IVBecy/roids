# ROIDS
A DLL injector for CS:GO

### How to use:
- Load up the CS:GO
- Run `roids.exe` with admin privs
- Add your dll via roids
If everything works, your dll should've been injected


### Compilation:
Open *roids.sln* and change the build config to `Release | x86` and press build.
At the end you should receive `roids.exe

Credi to[*Daniel Krupinski*](https://github.com/danielkrupinski) for the [injection method](https://github.com/danielkrupinski/OneByteLdr).     
This is really just a wrapper around his idea.
